Tools:
- https://mitmproxy.org/ (allow to capture network traffic as proxy and modify request and response)
- python
- scripts (enable proxy MacOs, request repeater)

Idea:
The site allow sql injection but conditional are only useful through a delay from the database.
Using the information before we can get administrator password using the following algorithm:
- Ask if a character in a given position of the password is equal to given one:
	- if true return NULL, request response time unaffected
	- if false return delay, request response time modified
	To speed up the process of password guessing we use Binary Search over the characters.
- Capture a request and replay it n time with the logic before, changing for the next character every
  time we found the given one for the position.
